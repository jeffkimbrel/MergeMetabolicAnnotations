    <p>The Merge Metabolic Annotations app allows the user to merge metabolic annotations from multiple sources present in the genome, using a simple, user-defined weighted-sum scoring scheme to decide which annotations to include. The resulting merged annotations will be added as a separate new annotation event in the genome, which can then be used for metabolic modeling by the <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/fba_tools/build_metabolic_model/release>Build Metabolic Model App</a>. </p>

    <p>Computational tools for assigning functional annotation to genes are known to be incomplete and inconsistent [1]. Annotated genomes typically contain 30–50% of genes without functional annotation [2], severely limiting our knowledge of the “parts lists” that the organisms have at their disposal. Individual annotation tools often return annotations for different subsets of genes, offering the potential to greatly increase the coverage of annotations by combining the outputs of multiple tools. As study of 27 bacterial reference genomes annotated using four different EC number prediction tools showed that using multiple tools can result in a drastically larger metabolic network reconstruction, adding on average 40% more EC numbers, and 37% more metabolic genes [1]. However integrating the different outputs from these tools in a cohesive manner remains a major challenge [3,4], due to differences in terminology and disagreements in functional annotations between the tools. Think of each annotation tool as an expert on a panel: each expert has their own strenths and weaknesses, but the experts don't always agree, and they often don't even speak the same language</p>

    <p>The Merge app solves these problems by mapping selected annotation sources in the genome that contain metabolic enzyme annotations to a common database of metabolic reactions: the ModelSEED Biochemistry Database [5]. With this common language of metabolic reactions, the user can then decide how to combine the inputs from each tool to derive a consensus annotation. In our analogy, a panel of experts could simply vote on the function for each gene. Or some experts could be given a higher weight in the vote based on their seniority or prior performance. In our implementation, the user assigns a weight to each annotation source they wish to merge. For each gene we then score the proposed functions based on the sum of weights attached to the annotation sources predicting that function. The user can also specify a minimum threshold score for a function to be included in the merged annotation, and can choose whether to include only the best annotation above that threshold, or all annotations above that threshold.</p>

    <p>This flexible scoring scheme can implement a wide range of merging policies the user may want to implement, including taking the union of all annotations, majority rule, a priority list, and much more. With carefully chosen weights, this scheme could even be used to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Naive Bayes classifier</a>, calculating the probability that gene X has function Y, given all of the annotation sources.</p>

    <p>The default settings assing a weight of 1 to each annotation source, and set the threshold to 1 as well, which is equivalent to taking the union of all annotations. This will result in the largest possible number of genes and reactions, but will also tend to include a large number of false positives. </p>
